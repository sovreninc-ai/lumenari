# RLS policy library

A reference catalog. Adapt these — don't copy blindly.

## 1. Public read, no public write

For catalog tables, content meant to be marketing.

```sql
alter table public.kits enable row level security;

create policy "kits public read"
  on public.kits for select
  using (true);

-- No insert/update/delete policy = nobody can write except service role.
```

## 2. Authenticated read, owner write

For per-user resources (todos, notes, saved searches).

```sql
alter table public.notes enable row level security;

create policy "notes read by owner"
  on public.notes for select
  using (owner_id = auth.uid());

create policy "notes write by owner"
  on public.notes for insert
  with check (owner_id = auth.uid());

create policy "notes update by owner"
  on public.notes for update
  using (owner_id = auth.uid())
  with check (owner_id = auth.uid());

create policy "notes delete by owner"
  on public.notes for delete
  using (owner_id = auth.uid());
```

Notice: the `with check` clause prevents an attacker from updating their own row to flip `owner_id` to someone else.

## 3. Tenant member read, tenant admin write

For shared org resources (events, projects, invoices).

```sql
alter table public.events enable row level security;

create policy "events read by org members"
  on public.events for select
  using (public.is_member_of(organization_id));

create policy "events written by org admins"
  on public.events for all
  using (public.has_role(organization_id, 'admin'))
  with check (public.has_role(organization_id, 'admin'));
```

## 4. Tenant member read, self write (collaborative posts)

```sql
alter table public.posts enable row level security;

create policy "posts read by org members"
  on public.posts for select
  using (public.is_member_of(organization_id));

create policy "posts inserted by org members"
  on public.posts for insert
  with check (
    public.is_member_of(organization_id)
    and author_id = auth.uid()
  );

create policy "posts edited by author or admin"
  on public.posts for update
  using (
    author_id = auth.uid()
    or public.has_role(organization_id, 'admin')
  )
  with check (
    author_id = auth.uid()
    or public.has_role(organization_id, 'admin')
  );
```

## 5. Parent-and-child rows (a coach can see athletes on their team)

When the access predicate is on a related table, push it into a function.

```sql
create or replace function public.coaches_athlete(athlete uuid)
returns boolean
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1
    from team_athletes ta
    join team_staff ts on ts.team_id = ta.team_id
    where ta.athlete_id = athlete
      and ts.staff_id = auth.uid()
      and ts.role in ('head_coach', 'assistant_coach')
  );
$$;

create policy "athlete profile read by coaches"
  on public.athlete_profiles for select
  using (public.coaches_athlete(athlete_id));
```

## 6. Time-bound access (the registration window)

```sql
create policy "registration writes during open window"
  on public.registrations for insert
  with check (
    public.is_member_of(organization_id)
    and now() between
      (select registration_opens_at from seasons where id = season_id)
      and (select registration_closes_at from seasons where id = season_id)
  );
```

## 7. Soft delete + invisible rows

Pattern: `deleted_at timestamptz` column. Default reads hide deleted rows.

```sql
create policy "events visible when not deleted"
  on public.events for select
  using (
    deleted_at is null
    and public.is_member_of(organization_id)
  );

-- Admins can see deleted rows for restore UI.
create policy "events visible to admin when deleted"
  on public.events for select
  using (
    deleted_at is not null
    and public.has_role(organization_id, 'admin')
  );
```

## The one test every policy needs

> Open two browser windows. Log in as user from org A in one and user from org B in the other. Try to read each other's data. If anything appears, you have a leak.

Automate that with an integration test using two anon clients with two different JWTs.
